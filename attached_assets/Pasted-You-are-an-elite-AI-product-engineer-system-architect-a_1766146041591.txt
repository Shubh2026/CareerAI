You are an elite AI product engineer, system architect, and UX-focused full-stack developer.

Your task is to build a production-grade MVP called **AI Career OS** — an AI-powered career intelligence platform for students and early-career developers.

The goal is NOT a generic app.
The goal is to simulate a **human career mentor + analyst + roadmap planner** in software form.

────────────────────────────────
1. PRODUCT VISION
────────────────────────────────

AI Career OS helps users answer:
• “Where do I stand right now?”
• “Which tech roles fit me best?”
• “What exact skills am I missing?”
• “What should I learn next, in what order, and why?”

The output must feel:
• Personalized
• Structured
• Insightful
• Non-generic
• Demo-ready for hackathons & recruiters

────────────────────────────────
2. TECH STACK & ARCHITECTURE
────────────────────────────────

Frontend:
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Component-driven architecture
- Clean SaaS-style UI

Backend:
- Node.js + Express (or Next.js API routes)
- Single `/analyze` endpoint
- Mock AI engine (rule-based + templates)

State & UX:
- Loading states
- Smooth auto-scroll to generated report
- Card-based report sections
- Progress indicators

No paid APIs.
No authentication required for MVP.

────────────────────────────────
3. USER FLOW (VERY IMPORTANT)
────────────────────────────────

A. Landing Page
- Brand: **AI Career OS**
- Headline: “Your AI-Powered Career Mentor”
- Subtext: Personalized career analysis, skill gap detection, and learning roadmap.
- CTA: “Analyze My Career”

B. Profile Intake (Career Context Form)
Collect:
- Name
- Current status (student / beginner / working professional)
- Years of experience (0–5+)
- Interests (multi-select):
  frontend, backend, full-stack, AI/ML, data, cloud, DevOps
- Known skills (text + chips)
- Confidence level (1–5)
- Career goal (job / internship / upskilling)

C. Submission Behavior
- Lock form
- Show animated loader:
  “Analyzing your profile…”
  “Mapping career paths…”
  “Generating roadmap…”

────────────────────────────────
4. AI ANALYSIS ENGINE (CORE LOGIC)
────────────────────────────────

Simulate an **AI reasoning pipeline**:

Step 1: Profile Understanding  
Summarize user background in human-like language.

Step 2: Career Matching  
Score and rank 2–3 roles using:
- Interests
- Skill alignment
- Experience
- Market relevance

Step 3: Skill Gap Analysis  
Split skills into:
- Strong foundations
- Partial knowledge
- Missing / critical gaps

Step 4: Roadmap Generation  
Create a phased roadmap with:
- Phase name
- Timeline
- Why this phase matters
- Exact skills & projects

────────────────────────────────
5. AI RESPONSE STRUCTURE (STRICT)
────────────────────────────────

Return a structured JSON like:

{
  "profileSummary": "Human-like paragraph summarizing the user",
  
  "careerFitScore": 82,

  "recommendedCareers": [
    {
      "title": "Frontend Developer",
      "matchPercentage": 85,
      "reasoning": "Why this role fits the user's interests and skills",
      "marketDemand": "High",
      "salaryIndia": "₹4–10 LPA"
    },
    {
      "title": "Full Stack Developer",
      "matchPercentage": 78,
      "reasoning": "...",
      "marketDemand": "Very High",
      "salaryIndia": "₹6–15 LPA"
    }
  ],

  "skillsGap": {
    "strengths": ["HTML", "CSS"],
    "needsImprovement": ["JavaScript fundamentals"],
    "missingCritical": ["React", "Backend basics"]
  },

  "roadmap": [
    {
      "phase": "Foundation",
      "timeline": "1–2 months",
      "focus": [
        "JavaScript fundamentals",
        "Git & GitHub",
        "Problem-solving basics"
      ],
      "outcome": "Strong programming foundation"
    },
    {
      "phase": "Core Role Skills",
      "timeline": "2–3 months",
      "focus": [
        "React",
        "APIs",
        "State management"
      ],
      "outcome": "Role-ready technical skills"
    },
    {
      "phase": "Projects & Proof",
      "timeline": "1–2 months",
      "focus": [
        "2–3 portfolio projects",
        "GitHub consistency",
        "Resume building"
      ],
      "outcome": "Job-ready profile"
    }
  ],

  "nextAction": "Start with JavaScript fundamentals and build a small project within 7 days."
}

────────────────────────────────
6. FRONTEND PRESENTATION RULES
────────────────────────────────

- Each report section must be visually separated
- Use:
  • cards
  • badges
  • progress bars
- Career match = animated progress bar
- Roadmap = vertical timeline or stacked cards
- Auto-scroll to report on generation

────────────────────────────────
7. QUALITY BAR
────────────────────────────────

- Code must be clean and readable
- Reusable components
- Comments where logic exists
- No placeholder lorem ipsum
- Output must feel like real AI insight

────────────────────────────────
8. FUTURE-READY NOTES (DO NOT BUILD NOW)
────────────────────────────────

Design so it can later support:
- Real LLM APIs (Gemini / OpenAI)
- User accounts
- Saved reports
- Resume analyzer
- Interview prep agent

────────────────────────────────
9. FINAL INSTRUCTION
────────────────────────────────

Build this as a **hackathon-grade MVP** that looks credible, intelligent, and polished.
Assume the evaluator is technical.

Deliver complete frontend + backend code with clear structure.
